👋 Hi, I’m @swozzy! I'm a soon-to-be-23-year-old college graduate from 🐪 Connecticut College

🌈 I'm a gay, first-generational 🇵🇱 Polish son of two immigrant parents

💻 I majored in computer science and minored in 🌸 Japanese linguistics 

🌱 I’m currently preparing for job interviews and casually (and excitedly) looking for my first place of employment

👀 I’m interested in everything and anything! But this mostly includes software and game development positions 

🛠 My skills (in order of proficiency) include: Python, Java, C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MATLAB, SQLite, and Scheme

👨‍💻 Some of the software and libraries I use include: VS Code, Unity 3D, GitHub, Django, Bootstrap, Google Firebase, and Rest APIs

🏓 When I'm not out and about in the great outdoors or trying to make traditional Polish or Japanese food, you can usually find me hiding behind a book learning about things related to my major or minor. Right now I'm learning 🐘 SQLite!

**Why don't you go ahead and check out some of the work I've done in the past? Go ahead, take a look!**
